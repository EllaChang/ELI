To run Micro SAM, run clisp, and once in the interpreter, run these 
lines (press return after each...)

  (load 'micro-sam)
  (process-story restaurant-story)

You can alternatively run

  (process-story kite-story)

To process the "kite" story instead.  The file "sam_trace.txt" contains 
a trace of the program running that includes a trace of function calls 
to better see how it works.
